The agent should always use industry-standard best practices to include documentation during development when writing new classes, methods, or functionalities.
Follow these guidelines when writing Python documentation:

-   Use Google-style docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules.
-   Include a concise summary line, followed by a detailed description if necessary.
-   Document all parameters with their type and a brief explanation.
-   Document return values with their type and a description.
-   Provide clear examples where appropriate.
-   Ensure consistent formatting and use of type hints.

Example:
```python
def calculate_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:
    """Calculates the area of a rectangle.

    Args:
        length: The length of the rectangle.
        width: The width of the rectangle.

    Returns:
        The area of the rectangle.
    """
    return length * width
